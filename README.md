# Python employee wage calculator

This is a python practice project used to calculate the wages of employees. Built with python 3 only

## Software Requirements
- python must be installed to run the program ( version 3+ )

## How to use?
1. To start using the program, firstly download the code( employeewage.py ) as a ZIP archive from the github repo above or using the link: https://github.com/drakejoshua/Python-employee-wage-calculator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

2. After downloading, unzip the archive and extract the employeewage.py from the archive. Then, navigate to the file location of the extracted file on your command line or in vs code and then run the program using the file

> *To run on the command line( command prompt or bash ), run the command:*
>> `C:\file_location>py employeewage.py`
>> or
>> `~/file_location>python3 employeewage.py`

> *if using visual studio code,*
>> just click 'run' in the menu bar and click 'run without debugging'. This should open up the CLI in the vscode window

3. After running, the program will prompt you for the employee level of the employee which can be either manager or worker or supervisor:

``` bash
welcome to the employee wage calculator

Enter an employee level >
```

4. Enter any of the listed employee level and then the program will ask you to enter the number of hours worked by that employee:

``` bash
welcome to the employee wage calculator

Enter an employee level > worker
Enter the number of hours worked by this employee >
```

5. The program then calculates and displays the wage of the employee and also asks if you want to recalculate the wage for another employee( if yes, enter YES or if not, enter any other thing such as: NO )

``` bash
welcome to the employee wage calculator

Enter an employee level > worker
Enter the number of hours worked by this employee > 30
        The wage for this employee is: 120
Do you want to re-calculate the wage for another employee? Enter YES to calculate >
```
